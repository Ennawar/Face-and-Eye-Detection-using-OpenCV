# Face-and-Eye-Detection-using-OpenCV
This project demonstrates how to detect human faces and eyes in real-time using OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library. The system uses pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifiers to identify faces and eyes from live webcam footage or images.
Hereâ€™s a clear and simple **project description** for a **Face and Eye Detection using OpenCV** project:

The main goal is to detect and highlight faces and eyes by drawing rectangles around them. This shows how computer vision can be used for basic facial feature detection, which can be further extended to applications like face recognition, surveillance, emotion detection, or user authentication.

 Key Features:

* Real-time face and eye detection through webcam.
* Uses Haar Cascade Classifiers provided by OpenCV.
* Draws rectangles around detected faces and eyes.
* Easy to run on any system with a camera and Python installed.

** Tools & Technologies Used:

* **Python**
* **OpenCV Library**
* **Haar Cascade XML files** for face and eye detection

** Outcome:
A simple, working demo that shows how machines can detect human faces and eyes automatically, providing a practical foundation for more advanced computer vision projects
